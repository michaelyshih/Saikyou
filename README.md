## Overview: ##


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyAnimeList is a very extensive encyclopedia and forum that allows users to look up anime with many sorting options, but they do not have a section to show the most popular shows (based on members watching) of each year. This project is an attempt to display the top 3 popular anime, manga, anime music of each year for the last 5years.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The project allows you to scroll through a timeline in 3d space following a path of the 5 years and look at the most popular anime / manga/ music of that year. There is a drop down that allows you to quickly access a year that you’re interested in. When clicked, the item you picked will display the information of the year with links and details to external sites where you could explore more.
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bonus: perspective on the background to display to traverse 3d space and view the animation as floating boxes in 3 dimensional space
